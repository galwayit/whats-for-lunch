## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Architecture Patterns
```dart
// Clean Architecture Layers
Domain Layer    → Business logic and entities
Data Layer      → Database and repository implementations  
Presentation    → UI components and state management

// Repository Pattern
Abstract interfaces in domain layer
Concrete implementations in data layer
Dependency injection through Riverpod providers
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables with relationships
users (id, name, preferences, created_at)
meals (id, user_id, restaurant_id, meal_type, cost, date, notes)
budget_trackings (id, user_id, amount, category, date)
restaurants (place_id, name, location, price_level, rating, cuisine_type, cached_at)
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Database Queries**: Sub-millisecond response times for common operations
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for large meal datasets with lazy loading
- **Animation Performance**: 60 FPS with proper lifecycle management
