3. **Smart Budget Analytics**: Provide encouraging insights and pattern recognition
4. **Achievement System**: Celebrate milestones and smart spending decisions
5. **Real-time Budget Impact**: Enhance meal logging with immediate budget feedback

### Success Criteria
- Budget setup completion rate >80%
- Positive user feedback on investment mindset approach

## 🏗️ DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Task 1: Investment Mindset Budget Setup Flow
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2.1 user preferences system  

#### 1.1 Budget Onboarding Experience
**Requirements**:
- **Welcome Screen**: "Plan Your Food Investment Journey"
  - Positive messaging: "Discover how you invest in experiences"
  - Visual: Upward trending chart illustration
  - CTA: "Start Planning My Food Adventures"

- **Budget Selection Interface**:
  - Weekly/Monthly toggle with smooth animation
  - Preset options: "$50/week", "$200/month", "Custom"
  - Investment framing: "How much do you want to invest in food experiences?"
  - Helper text: "This helps you make mindful choices, not restrictions"

- **Category Customization**:
  - Default categories: "Quick Bites", "Social Dining", "Special Treats", "Healthy Choices"
  - Customizable labels with positive defaults
  - Allocation sliders with percentage display
  - Visual preview of budget distribution

#### 1.2 Technical Implementation
```dart
class BudgetSetupFlow extends ConsumerStatefulWidget {
  // Multi-step wizard with progress indicator
  // Investment mindset messaging throughout
  // Form validation with positive error messages
  // Auto-save on each step completion
}

class BudgetPreferences {
  final double weeklyAmount;
  final double monthlyAmount;
  final Map<String, double> categoryAllocations;
  final String investmentGoal; // "mindful_spending", "experience_focus", etc.
  final bool enableAchievements;
  final bool enableInsights;
}
```

#### 1.3 Database Integration
- Extend existing user preferences with budget settings
- Create budget_periods table for historical tracking
- Implement budget_goals table for achievement tracking
- Add category_spending table for analytics

### Task 2: Circular Progress Visualization System
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 12-16 hours  
**Dependencies**: Budget setup, meal logging data  

#### 2.1 Investment Progress Rings
**Design Requirements**:
- **Primary Ring**: Overall budget progress (circular, not linear bar)
- **Secondary Rings**: Category-specific progress (concentric or side-by-side)

  - Orange highlight: Approaching goal (90-100% spent)
  - Purple celebration: Goal achieved with surplus

#### 2.2 Visual Elements
```dart
class InvestmentProgressRing extends StatefulWidget {
  final double progress; // 0.0 to 1.0
  final String category;
  final double spent;
  final double allocated;
  final String messageType; // "encouraging", "celebration", "guidance"
  
  // Animated rendering using CustomPainter
  // Smooth progress transitions
  // Haptic feedback on milestones
  // Accessibility labels for screen readers
}
```

#### 2.3 Messaging Strategy

- **50-75% spent**: "You're making mindful choices - keep it up!"
- **75-90% spent**: "Almost there! Consider some quick bites for balance."
- **90-100% spent**: "Goal reached! You've invested wisely in experiences."
- **Over budget**: "You valued extra experiences this period - that's okay!"

### Task 3: Smart Budget Analytics Engine
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 10-14 hours  
**Dependencies**: Meal data, budget settings  

#### 3.1 Analytics Calculations
```dart
class BudgetAnalyticsService {

  // Predictive insights
  Future<BudgetForecast> generateSpendingForecast();
  
  // Achievement tracking
  Future<List<Achievement>> checkAchievements(int userId);
}
```

#### 3.2 Encouraging Insights Generation
**Insight Categories**:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: "You love weekend brunches - 60% of social dining happens Saturday-Sunday"
2. **Smart Choices**: "Your quick bites average $8 - perfect for maintaining your investment goals"
3. **Achievement Highlights**: "This week you stayed within budget for 5 days - excellent mindful planning!"
4. **Optimization Suggestions**: "Consider one more home meal this week to reach your savings goal"

#### 3.3 Real-time Budget Impact Display
- Integration with meal entry form from Phase 2.1
- Live calculation: "This investment leaves you $X for the rest of the week"
- Category suggestion: "This fits perfectly in your 'Social Dining' allocation"
- Alternative suggestions: "Consider this as a 'Special Treat' instead?"

### Task 4: Achievement & Celebration System
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours  
**Dependencies**: Budget analytics, user behavior tracking  

#### 4.1 Achievement Categories
**Milestone Achievements**:
- "First Week Complete": Successfully track budget for 7 days

class AchievementCelebration extends StatefulWidget {
  final Achievement achievement;
  
  // Full-screen celebration animation
  // Confetti or sparkle effects
  // Haptic feedback burst
  // Social sharing prompt
  // "Continue Journey" CTA
}
```

#### 4.3 Progress Motivation

- "Almost there!" notifications for near-achievements
- Weekly achievement digest
- Monthly accomplishment summary

### Task 5: Budget Preference Management
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours  
**Dependencies**: User preferences system  

#### 5.1 Settings Interface
- **Budget Adjustment**: Easy modification of weekly/monthly amounts
- **Category Management**: Add/remove/rename spending categories
- **Goal Setting**: Investment objectives and motivation
