  preferences TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Diet tracking
CREATE TABLE meals (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,

});

final restaurantSearchProvider = FutureProvider.family<List<Restaurant>, SearchParams>((ref, params) {
  return ref.read(restaurantServiceProvider).searchNearby(params);
});

final recommendationProvider = StateNotifierProvider<RecommendationNotifier, RecommendationState>((ref) {
  return RecommendationNotifier(
