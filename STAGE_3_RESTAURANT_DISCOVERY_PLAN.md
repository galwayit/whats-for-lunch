## Technical Architecture & Requirements

### Google Maps API Integration Strategy

**Core APIs Required**:
```dart
// Primary APIs for restaurant discovery
- Places API Nearby Search: $17 per 1000 requests
- Place Details API: $17 per 1000 requests  
- Geocoding API: $5 per 1000 requests
- Maps SDK for Flutter: $7 per 1000 map loads
```

**Cost Projection** (1000 users, 50 searches/user/month):
- Nearby Search: 50,000 requests × $0.017 = $850
- Place Details: 10,000 requests × $0.017 = $170  
- Geocoding: 5,000 requests × $0.005 = $25
- Map Loads: 25,000 loads × $0.007 = $175
- **Total**: ~$1,220 without optimization

**With Optimization** (targeting <$85/month):
- 90% cache hit rate: $122
- Field masking (50% savings): $61
- Session tokens: Additional 20% savings = **$49/month**

### Database Schema Enhancements

**Enhanced Restaurant Entity**:
```dart
class Restaurant {
  final String placeId;           // Google Place ID (existing)
  final String name;              // Restaurant name (existing)
  final String location;          // Address string (existing) 
  final int? priceLevel;         // 1-4 scale (existing)
  final double? rating;          // 1-5 stars (existing)
  final String? cuisineType;     // Category (existing)
  final DateTime cachedAt;       // Cache timestamp (existing)
  
  // New fields for Stage 3
  final double? latitude;        // Precise coordinates
  final double? longitude;       // Precise coordinates
  final String? phoneNumber;     // Contact information
  final List<String>? openingHours; // Operating hours
  final String? photoReference; // Google Photos reference
  final bool isOpen;            // Real-time status
  final int? distanceMeters;    // Distance from user
  final Map<String, dynamic>? metadata; // Flexible data storage
}
```

**New Search Cache Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE search_cache (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  user_location TEXT,           -- "lat,lng" format
  radius_meters INTEGER,
  cuisine_filter TEXT,
  price_filter INTEGER,
  search_results TEXT,          -- JSON array of place IDs
  cached_at DATETIME,
  expires_at DATETIME
);
```

### Location Services Architecture

**Permission Management**:
```dart
class LocationService {
  // Progressive permission requests
  static Future<LocationPermission> requestPermission() async {
    // Request "when in use" first
    // Upgrade to "always" only if needed
    // Handle denied permissions gracefully
  }
  
  // Battery-optimized location tracking
  static Stream<Position> getLocationStream({
    LocationAccuracy accuracy = LocationAccuracy.balanced,
    int distanceFilter = 50, // Update only when user moves 50m
  });
}
```

**Geofencing Implementation**:
```dart
class RestaurantGeofencing {
  // Radius-based restaurant notifications
  static void setupGeofences(List<Restaurant> restaurants) {
    // Create 100m radius around saved/favorite restaurants
    // Trigger notifications for special offers
    // Respect user notification preferences
  }
}
```

## User Experience Design Requirements
