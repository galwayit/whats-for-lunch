## Database Architecture

### Decision: Drift ORM with SQLite
**Date**: Stage 1 Development  
**Status**: Implemented

#### Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Drift provides compile-time type checking for all database operations
- **Code Generation**: Automatic generation of typesafe DAOs and table classes
- **Flutter Integration**: Native Dart implementation with excellent Flutter support
- **Offline-First**: SQLite enables full offline functionality as required
- **Performance**: Local database provides sub-millisecond query performance
- **Testing**: In-memory database support enables comprehensive testing

#### Alternatives Considered
1. **Hive**: Rejected due to lack of relational capabilities and complex query support
2. **Realm**: Rejected due to licensing concerns and learning curve
3. **Firebase Firestore**: Rejected due to offline-first requirement and cost implications
4. **Raw SQLite**: Rejected due to boilerplate code and type safety concerns

#### Implementation Details
```dart
// Core tables implemented:
- Users: User profiles with JSON preferences storage
- Meals: Meal logging with restaurant association
- BudgetTrackings: Budget management with category support
- Restaurants: Restaurant caching with Google Places integration
```

#### Future Implications
- Scalable to millions of meal records per user
- Easy migration path for schema changes
- Foundation ready for complex queries in AI recommendation engine
- Testing infrastructure supports rapid feature development

## Entity Architecture

### Decision: UserEntity with JSON Preferences
**Date**: Stage 1 Development  
**Status**: Implemented

#### Rationale
- **Flexibility**: JSON storage allows dynamic preference expansion without schema changes
- **Type Safety**: UserPreferences class provides compile-time validation
- **Serialization**: Easy integration with API endpoints and state management
- **Performance**: Single table lookup with structured data access

#### Implementation Details
```dart
class UserEntity {
  final int? id;
  final String name;
  final Map<String, dynamic> preferences; // Serialized UserPreferences
  final DateTime createdAt;
}

class UserPreferences {
  final int budgetLevel;
  final double maxTravelDistance;
  final bool includeChains;
  // Extensible without database migration
}
```

#### Conversion Strategy
- Database layer handles JSON serialization/deserialization
- Domain layer works with typed UserPreferences objects
- Repository pattern abstracts conversion complexity

---

## State Management Architecture

### Decision: Riverpod with Repository Pattern
**Date**: Stage 1 Development  
**Status**: Implemented

#### Rationale
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns with testable providers
- **Compile-time Safety**: Better type checking than Provider
- **Performance**: Granular rebuilds and efficient state updates
- **Testing**: Easy mocking and isolation of business logic
- **Scalability**: Supports complex state relationships as app grows

#### Architecture Pattern
```dart
// Repository injection
final databaseProvider = Provider<AppDatabase>((ref) => AppDatabase());

final userRepositoryProvider = Provider<UserRepository>((ref) {
  return UserRepositoryImpl(ref.read(databaseProvider));
});

// State providers
final userPreferencesProvider = StateNotifierProvider<UserPreferencesNotifier, UserPreferencesState>((ref) {
  return UserPreferencesNotifier(ref.read(userRepositoryProvider));
});
```

#### Benefits for AI Integration
- Clean separation between data layer and AI logic
- Easy mocking for recommendation testing
- Reactive UI updates when recommendations change
- Scalable for complex recommendation state management

## UX Component Library

### Decision: Accessible-First Component Architecture
**Date**: Stage 1 Development  
**Status**: Implemented

#### Rationale
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance built into every component
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across entire application
- **Performance**: Optimized touch targets and haptic feedback
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for styling and behavior
- **Testing**: Semantic labels enable comprehensive UI testing

#### Key Design Principles
1. **44px Minimum Touch Targets**: Ensures thumb-friendly mobile interaction
2. **Semantic Labels**: Every interactive element has descriptive labels
3. **Haptic Feedback**: Light impact feedback for all button interactions
4. **Material Design 3**: Modern design system with dynamic color support
5. **Loading States**: Built-in loading and error states for async operations

#### Component Architecture
```dart
// Base components with accessibility built-in
- UXPrimaryButton: Main CTAs with loading states
- UXSecondaryButton: Secondary actions with consistent styling
- UXTextInput: Form inputs with real-time validation
- UXProgressIndicator: Onboarding progress with semantic values
- UXLoadingOverlay: Non-blocking loading states
- UXErrorState: Consistent error handling with recovery actions
- UXCard: Accessible containers with optional interactions
- UXFadeIn: Smooth animations with proper lifecycle management
```

#### Animation Strategy
- Smooth 300ms transitions with easeInOut curves
- Configurable delays for staggered animations
- Proper disposal handling for test environments
- Accessibility-aware animations (respects system preferences)

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive Test Coverage with In-Memory Database
**Date**: Stage 1 Development  
**Status**: Implemented

#### Rationale
- **Database Testing**: In-memory database enables full CRUD testing without persistence
- **Entity Validation**: Type-safe conversion testing ensures data integrity
- **Performance**: Fast test execution with isolated test environments
- **Coverage**: All business logic paths tested before UI development

#### Test Architecture
```dart
// Database layer testing
- User operations: CRUD with preference management
- Meal operations: Logging with date range filtering  
- Budget operations: Category-based tracking
- Restaurant operations: Caching with upsert behavior
- Entity conversion: Round-trip data integrity

// Component testing
- Accessibility: Semantic labels and touch targets
- Animations: Proper lifecycle and disposal
- Loading states: Async operation handling
```

#### Future Testing Strategy
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for complete user flows
- Performance tests for large datasets
- API mocking for external service integration

## Performance Decisions

### Decision: Offline-First with Intelligent Caching
**Date**: Stage 1 Development  
**Status**: Foundation Implemented

#### Rationale
- **User Experience**: Instant app response regardless of network connectivity
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize API calls through strategic caching
- **Reliability**: Core functionality works in all network conditions
- **Performance**: Local database queries provide sub-millisecond response times

#### Caching Strategy
- Restaurant data: 24-hour cache with automatic refresh
- User preferences: Local storage with cloud sync
- Meal records: Local-first with background synchronization
- AI responses: Cache similar queries to reduce API costs

#### Query Optimization
- Indexed foreign key relationships
- Date range queries optimized for common patterns
- Batch operations for bulk data updates
- Lazy loading for large datasets

- **Compliance**: Easier GDPR/privacy regulation compliance
- **Cost**: Reduced server infrastructure requirements

#### Data Protection Strategy
- Local SQLite encryption (planned for Stage 2)
- Minimal data transmission to external APIs
- User consent for location data sharing
- Anonymized analytics collection

#### Services Selected
1. **Google Maps Platform**: Places API for restaurant discovery
2. **Google Gemini**: AI recommendations with cost optimization
3. **Geocoding API**: Location processing and address resolution

#### Cost Optimization Strategy
- Aggressive local caching (24-hour restaurant data)
- Session tokens for Places Autocomplete
- Batch processing for AI recommendations
- Rate limiting and request debouncing
- Fallback to cached data when API limits reached

#### Integration Architecture
- Repository pattern abstracts API complexity
- Offline-first design with graceful degradation
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
